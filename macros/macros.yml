  - name: generate_schema_name
    description: >
      Custom schema naming macro used to safely isolate developer environments
      while preserving stable schemas in non-development environments.

      In development (`target.name == 'dev'`), this macro appends the current
      developer identifier to the base schema name to prevent collisions
      between developers working on the same BigQuery project.

      In non-development environments (e.g. staging, prod), schemas resolve
      deterministically using either the explicitly configured custom schema
      name or the default target schema.

      This macro is critical for enabling safe parallel development,
      cost isolation, and CI/CD workflows in multi-developer analytics teams.

    arguments:
      - name: custom_schema_name
        type: string
        description: >
          Optional schema name explicitly defined in model configuration.
          If provided, this value is used in non-development environments.

      - name: node
        type: dict
        description: >
          The dbt node object representing the model being built.
          This argument is provided automatically by dbt and is not
          intended to be passed manually.

        - Developer schemas may accumulate over time and should be cleaned up
          periodically via scheduled BigQuery housekeeping jobs.


  - name: assert_not_prod
    description: >
      Safety assertion macro that prevents accidental execution of dbt runs
      against the production environment.

      This macro is typically used as a project-level `pre-hook` to fail fast
      if a developer attempts to run dbt commands targeting production
      unintentionally.

      It acts as a guardrail against costly or destructive operations,
      especially in local development and ad-hoc execution contexts.

  - name: account_status_from_event
    description: >
      Convenience macro that standardises account status derivation logic
      across models.

      This macro encapsulates the mapping between lifecycle event types
      and their corresponding account states (e.g. open or closed),
      ensuring consistent logic wherever account status is required.

      Centralising this logic prevents drift between models and makes
      lifecycle behaviour easier to update and audit.

    arguments:
      - name: event_type
        type: string
        description: >
          Lifecycle event type value (e.g. 'created', 'closed', 'reopened')
          used to determine the resulting account status.
